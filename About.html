					<div class="me">
						<p>See that guy with the hair up there? That's me, Germain!</p>
						<p>
							I am currently studying at University of California, Irvine in pursue of getting a Bachelors degree in Informatics.
							I am fairly new to web design and web development but with the knowledge I have obtained and will continue to receive I aspire to someday be a great designer.
						</p>
						<p>
							During my time at UCI I have been part of many group projects and have contributed to a few sites and projects.
							One of my favorite hobbies since the day I can remember has been playing video games, because of this I hope to use my skills in design to one day dedicate my time to designing and developing sites for a company in the gaming industry.

				<div class="accSections" id="InterestsSection">
					<div class="interests">
						<ul>
							<li>Web Design</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							This is a newfound interest that I encountered during an internship.
							Although I didn't use CSS to format the site I worked with, I found it incredibly interesting to have control over the sites appearance, content, and functionality. </p>
						<p>
							Using CSS, JS, and HTML to create a site from scratch is not a new concept to me but I haven't had too much experience with it yet.
							I am not the greatest at web design at the moment but I will keep working on refining my skills and hopefully someday be a great designer.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Drawing</li>
						</ul>

						<p>I don't spend my time drawing as often as I should, or I used to, but I have always enjoyed drawing since I can remember. Im not the greatest at it but I keep improving and thats what makes it fun!</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Video Games</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							I spend a lot of my free time playing all sorts of video games. And I mean a lot.</p>
						<p>
							I wasn't very wealthy growing up and I can still recall the excitement that ran through me when I got my first video game console (the N64).
							My mom bought it off my uncle for a measly 20 dollars and the only game it came with was Pokemon Stadium and yet I spent months playing it every day.</p>
						<p>
							Since then I've always been a video game fanatic and I actually hoard all the games I've ever owned.
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Basketball</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							I enjoy watching the NBA, my favorite team is the Los Angeles Lakers.
							Naturally, as I am a young Lakers fan, my favorite NBA (ex-NBA now) player has always been and will be Kobe Bryant.</p>
						<p>
							I used to play basketball occasionally but now its hardly what you would call a hobby
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Anime</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							During my free time, or whenever I can to be honest, I love watching Anime.
							I prefer it over watching regular television or cartoons.</p>
						<p>
							I even took a japanese course my sophomore year in college to better understand the language and make watching Anime more enjoyable.
							I can't write the language fluently, but I can speak, hear, and read the language at a decent level.
